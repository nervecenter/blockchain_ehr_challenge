# Blockchain Electronic Health Record Challenge
### Presented at the 2018 Society for Technology in Anesthesia's
### Annual Meeting Engineering Challenge in Miami, FL

This project implements a UI for writing basic medical health record data, in
end-to-end encrypted form, to an Ethereum blockchain. A local Python script interacts
with a deployed Ethereum smart contract which reads or writes the encrypted data to the
blockchain; only the patient's key, at a client, may encrypt or decrypt their data.
